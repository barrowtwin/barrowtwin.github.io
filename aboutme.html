									<p>My name is Eric Barrow</p>

								<div class="image main"><img src="images/me.jpg" alt="" class="image left"/></div>
								<p>I am a very driven person who strives to be the best at anything I set myself to. I can be very competitive in certain situations, and have demonstrated my ability to learn things quickly.</p>
								<p>I believe I have finally found the career field I am passionate about and am interested in stepping into it. My goal is to find a job with professional, driven co-workers who can push me further into this career field and a compatible work environment for me.</p>
								<p>Outside of work I enjoy playing games with a great group of friends that has manifested itself over many random encounters over the years. With these friends, I have enjoyed playing games like World of Warcraft, League of Legends, Path of Exile, Diablo, Overwatch, Apex Legends, and Sea of Thieves. Thats just scratching the surface too, the list goes on and on.</p>
								<p>Alongside playing games, I do enjoy watching eSports matches. Specifically League of Legends matches. I have watched professional League for many years and always watch the "superbowl" of league (Worlds Tournament) each year.</p>
								<p>Aside from gaming, I have enjoyed being part of a billiards team for a short time. I played in an APA league in Beaumont, TX and reached a rating of playing as a rank 6. I was proud of my imporvements I made in the time I played with my team, and may jump back into the league at some point in the future.</p>
