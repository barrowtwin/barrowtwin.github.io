									<h2><a href="https://youtu.be/zGj2EaCRGMc" target="_blank">Poker Game</a></h2>
									<p>This was my favorite project I worked on. It was a poker game coded with java and css. Some of my favorite parts of the program to code were the avatar selector and the theme selector. I also really liked using javafx's panes, which made it easy to keep the layout of the game clean. Click the image or title to watch a video of the game being played.</p>

										<h2><a href="https://youtu.be/gBMAkQSrjT8" target="_blank">Zombie Game</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://youtu.be/gBMAkQSrjT8" class="image fit" target="_blank"><img src="images/zombie.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This was another game I created for a game development class I took. It was written in C++, using GXToolkit library. I also used Lightwave3d and Audacity for creating objects and sounds in the game. I think the most challenging part of this project was coming up with the mechanics of the zombies while also working with a game loop. Each zombie spawns at a random location around the outer edge of the playing zone and then makes its way to a nearby flame. If the player is within a certain distance from a zombie, the zombie will change its desire to reach the fire to a desire to reach the player. The goal of the game for the player was to collect all 3 medicine boxes without getting infected by the wandering zombies.</p>

										<h2><a href="https://youtu.be/b3IDU1XcPd8" target="_blank">Voter System</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://youtu.be/b3IDU1XcPd8" class="image fit" target="_blank"><img src="images/voting.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This was a voting system I had to create for my software engineering class. I worked with another student to create a command prompt voting system that would display a ballot and take votes which would be saved to a text file discretely. That meant that no voter information was tied to each vote, and votes would be saved to a txt file after the program closed and could be recounted when the program was reopened. My favorite parts of this project were coming up with how to make votes persist after program close and also coming up with how to cleanly prompt the user for information and display it in command prompt.</p>
